## The current working branch for the project
# This is a class project and the code will not be ideal what so ever. I will stumble around until it meets the minium requierment for the classes proctors. If this were a actual project that I plan on releasing then I would of put more time and effort into making it look pretty and structuring the code better.
# for example I would use a collection of some kind for that database, make the string not public, this is a desktop app but would probably be more accessable on the web, and so on.
